JAVA POINT
JVM is java virtual machine. Basically its a specification of JRE implementation.
JVM does 3 tasks.
1) class laoder ; Bootstrap loader,extention loader,APPLICATIO LAODER
2)Memory Allocation
3) Execution ; virtaul processor,interpreter,JIT


JAVA have uninary operator(x++,--x etc),airthmatic(x+y,-,*,/,%),logical(&&,||),bitwise(|,&),assignment(a=a+5 etc),comparison(a==b) operator.



Program :
a matrix is sparce matrix if number of zero's are greater then (number of element/2)
A matrix is said to be an identity matrix if it is a square matrix in which elements of principle diagonal are ones, 
and the rest of the elements are zeroes.

Type of testing on the basis of objective ;
!)Functional Testing - To validate behaviour of system is as per the functional specification and is to verify that product is ready to be
delivered in the market.
Steps in fun. testing : understanding the requirement,clearing the doubts,writing TC,Identifying test input ,expected output,testing,comparing output with expected output.
2) Non-Functional Testing : Performance,Security,Compability,usability.



Type of testing on the basis of testing method
1)Manual 2) Automated Testing


based on design technique:

whiteBox Testing/glass box testing/structural based testing
In it tester have acceess to internal architectur/design/code of the system.its purpose is to enusre code coverage,resualbity and code optimisation.
 

black box Testing(Specification based testing)
In it tester does not have access to internal implementation/architectur of system.
User validate the system on the basis of it requirement.

Grey Box Testing
in it tester have limited access to interal architecture.its helps the tester in performing the testing better.


Type of testing on the basis of testing level.
1) Unit Testing : its a level of testing in whihc indivual unit/component is tested.Unit  is smallest executable component.
its first level testing.
Unit testing is done to check each unit is working as per design.
we should try to make component which are less dependable on other.
Unit testing is done with the help of unit testing framework,stub,driver,data.

its done by devlopers.
in procedurabl language ,program ,function,procedure are unit.
in object oriented ,methods are units.

benifits :
1) earlier detection of error
2) when ever changes done ,we execute the test and find the error in the indiviual module and correct it.we don't need to run whole system(fire GUI)
which take time to run.
3) as we need to test units so we make less dependable units which led to take less time to test units.
4)the cost of fixing defect is faster.
5) error detection is easy.

 
2)Integration Testing : in this integration of related module is tested .here integration issue is focused.
  big bang  testing{checcked after all module are testing}
  top down approach : In this upper level module is testing first and stubs are needed to simulate lower level of moduls.
  bottom up approach :
  hybrid approach :

  
ball-pen example to describe testing type.  
  
3)System Testing : in this testing, complete integrated moduel is testing to valaidate if it as per the requirement.
black box testing;


4)Acceptance Testing : this testing is done to check whethe system is acceptable.
this is done by user.and after that sw is released for production.
1) alpha testing(or internal acceptance testing): here testing is done by user at the devloper's site.
2) Beta testing : here testing is done by the end user and they provide reviews .


Smoke Testing :
During smoke testing,we check the core,main fuctionality is working or not,so that we can proceed with testing .
its save time and effort.
Eg : device Call,message is going on.

Sanity Testing : Sanity testing is done to check to check fix the of bug has been applied (if not then reject the build)and new feature
functionality()working roughly as expected or the dev. have applied some logic or not in the new feature.
ex : 2+2=5 in case of calculator.
Sanity testing is done on a component on which changes has been done.
Sanity testing dosn't have defined test cases.

Regression Testing : Regression testing is done to checck where recent changes/fix effecting the other functinlity of the system.
Regression Testing method : -Retest all,
                            -priority based Regression
                            -regression plan		
In it already executed test cases are being run.							


Monkey Tesing  : In monkey Testing, whole system is tested wihtout predefined test case.
                 Anything can be tested in it. Performed to find new kind of bugs.
				 
				 
Gorrilla Testing : In it some modules being tested again and again in same manner to enusre the system is working correcctly.
				 
				 
				 
Ad hoc Testing does not follow any structured way of testing and it is randomly done on any part of application.
 Main aim of this testing is to find defects by random checking.
 Adhoc testing can be achieved with the Software testing technique called Error Guessing. 
 Error guessing can be done by the people having enough experience on the system to "guess" the most likely source of errors.
Usually adhoc testing is performed after the formal test execution. 
This testing requires no documentation/ planning /process to be followed. 	

In Monkey Testing testers may not know what is the system is all about and its purpose			 
In Ad-hoc Testing tester must understand the system significantly before performing testing				 


Iterator which throws ConcurrentModificationException(CME) when they are iterating a collection and parallely another thread tries to update them.
Java 1.4 most of the collections are fail fast .eg. ArrayList,HashSet,HashMap.

Iterator which allow to do modification on collection while iterating them are called fail safe iterator.
these works on copy of origional collection . But in this case you don't get the updated data as you work on the copy.
Java 1.5 ConcurrentCollections are fail safe. eg. ConcurrentHashMap,CopyonwriteArrayList. etc....

when we use Collection remove() method while traversing the collection using Iterator then it will through CME.so for this
we need to use Iterator remove method.

HashTable,SynchronizedMap,Vector are thread safe & can be used in multithreaded application but when the size of data increases
then they becomes very slow as they take lock on whole collection compare to ConcurretnHashMap(Concurrent Collection intorduted from java1.5)
which take partial lock .

Iterator vs Enumeration
Itertor can modify the colleciton as it got remove method whereas legacy class Enumeration is read only. no method to remove or 
add .
Iterator is more safe.


=>How does HashSet is implemented in Java, How does it use Hashing? (answer)
This is a tricky question in Java because for hashing you need both key and value and there is no key for the store it in a bucket,
 then how exactly HashSet store element internally. Well, HashSet is built on top of HashMap.
 If you look at source code of java.util.HashSet class, you will find that that it uses a HashMap with same values for all keys,
 as shown below:

private transient HashMap map;
private static final Object PRESENT = new Object();
When you call add() method of HashSet, it put entry in HashMap :

public boolean add(E e) {
 return map.put(e, PRESENT)==null;
}

Since keys are unique in a HashMap, it provides uniqueness guarantee of Set interface.


8. What do you need to do to use a custom object as a key in Collection classes like Map or Set? (answer)
The answer is: If you are using any custom object in Map as key, you need to override equals() and hashCode() method,
 and make sure they follow their contract. On the other hand if you are storing a custom object in Sorted Collection 
 e.g. SortedSet or SortedMap, you also need to make sure that your equals() method is consistent to compareTo() method,
 otherwise that collection will not follow there contacts e.g. Set may allow duplicates.

 
HashMap is a general purpose Map (hash table based data structure), 
which should be used whenever you need a hashing-based data structure for storing your mappings (key-value pairs).
while TreeMap is red black tree base Navigable Map which provide sorting apart from hashtable.
LinkedHashMap is a compromise bw these two.
All these are not synchronized so faster compare to HashTable which is synchronized.
Map can be made sync. by Collections.concurrentMap(c) but its better if we use ConcurrentHashMap.
One null key and multiple null values allowed in HashMap and LinkedHashMap but not in Tree and HashTable.



 In Summary use ArrayList if you are using ArrayList in Single threaded environment and use Vector if you need a
 thread-safe collection. ArrayList is anytime faster than Vector in case thread-safety is not a concern.
 
 HashSet vs HashMap
 Implements Set Interface    Map 
   No duplicates             duplicate value but not key
   single null value       one duplicate value and mulitple key values
   slower compare to HashMap

=>Prioroty(Visibility) : How import/urgently issue needs to be fixed
Urgent,high,medium,lower

Severeity(Impact) : How severly bug is effecting the system.Degree of impact.
Critical,major,minor,trivial

High Priorty and Low Severeity : If Company's logo is wrong on the home page.
H P H S : Website is showing error on home page. Mobile is not makeing to able call. Device is getting crash after bootup.
L P HS : if the device/web getting crash in a corner scenario. Scenario is not used by many customers.
LPLS : text is not getting display in any corner scenario.



=>Build is an executable file which refers to that part of an application which is handed over to a tester to test the implemented 
functionality of the application along with some bug fixes. The build can be rejected by the testing 
team if it does not pass the critical checklist which contains the major functionality of the application.

There can be multiple builds in the testing cycle of an application.
Release refers to the software application which is no longer in the testing phase and after completion of testing
 and development, the application is handed over to the client. One release has several builds associated with it.

=>Important point that should be consider while while writing test cases:
Full undetstanding of the system/requirement,nothing should be assumed.
All features should be covered.Nothing should left.User traceblity matrix is being used to check that every requirement is implementted and being tested.
All the functional and non functional requirement should be covered.
Tc Prioritasation ,Checking that all the , No redundancy ,simple language.

=>Stress vs Load Testing
In stress testing ,system is bound to tested in excertion/stress i.e to exeecute the system beyond the threashold limit of break to determinewhen
does the system crashes. Its also check that when does the system recover once the load reduces.
this condition generally occur when user or data size increases.

L.T - In load testing system is checked with diff. load to find the peak performance of the server,throughput,responce time.
