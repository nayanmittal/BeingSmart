Jmeter simulates multiple user sending request to server & returns the statistics that show the performance of the target server/application via tables & graphs.
A test plan can be considered as a container for running tests.. it contains  thread groups,logic controller,data generators ,listners ,

Samplers are uses to create the request.You can define type of request(http,Ftp...)
Listeners are the reports.[view results in table,view result in tree,assertion result,aggregate report,graph result,simple data writer]
Assertions : is a check on the response. Check responce code, format,duration ,body,size [resiponse assertion,duration assertions,size assertion,html assertion,xml,xpath[api]]

Recording UI test in Jmeter. 
Badboy[need to export reocrded script to Jmeter ,works on windows.] & Blazemeter[it itself uses Jmeter in background & comes as chrome plugin -works on window,mac] can be used to record ui test & then do the performance testing 
then add listeners & assertion to verify .




GitHUb is a version control system/source control of the file stored on system and on multipli users working paralelly.
basically a online repository where multiple user can work together onsame project and be insync.



==========Jenkins=============================
Jenkins is a Opens source automation server used for continuous integration and deployment.
It serves us all the task of software development building,testing,report generation and deployment 

Jenkins helps in scheduling the test suppose you want to run it every night or at 3am daily or every week or every month.
Jenkins keeps on pulling the code from GIT(version management tool/central repository) after defined time (like after every 30m) and as soon as any team member commit/save
the code on GIT it automatically start running the build(running the code) and if any error comes it mails to all the members.
so its help to find out the error/problem at the time of code change[early stages]

what's continuous integration/deployment:
In continuous Integration whenever there is commit, software is build and tested immediately is. In A large project,Multiple developers works together,commits are done
many times a day,so whenever a commit is made ,jenkin build and test it. If test is pass then it check it for deployment.If deployment is success then pushed for production. So commit,build,test,deployment is a continuous process.

The trigger for execution for time or event based.
A Continuous Integration Pipeline is a powerful instrument that consists of a set of tools designed to host, monitor, compile and test code, or code changes, like:

Continuous Integration Server (Jenkins, Bamboo, CruiseControl, TeamCity, and others)
Source Control Tool (e.g., CVS, SVN, GIT, Mercurial, Perforce, ClearCase and others)
Build tool (Make, ANT, Maven, Ivy, Gradle, and others)
Automation testing framework (Selenium, Appium, TestComplete, UFT, and others)\

Suppose you haves thousands of test cases and it would take 6-7 hrs to execute. and you want when u come morning in the office you want yr results.
so you need to trigger it and 2Am in the mrng(also if you want it to exclude daily.)
  
Whenever developer pushes a new code,jenkins sees it and automatically pushes the test cases.
  
Jenkin run java & testng on its own server so we need to mention the version of these.
  
Continuous feedback pertaining to things like coding or architectural issues, build failures, test status and file release uploads was missing due to which the quality of software can go down.
